## Motivation

Distributing an iOS app is pretty painful in current world.

There are totally 3 ways to show your app.

  1. AppStore
  2. AdHoc
  3. Install directly with your Mac

Using [Appstore](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SubmittingYourApp/SubmittingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH9-SW1) to distribute your app is the most common and recommended way but also very painful to wait for the reviewing.

Sometimes we just wants to show our app to friends and let them try first. You are not iron man and it will be quite hard to take your Macbook to visit every friends you want to impress.

AdHoc would be the best way for you to share your app with your friends.

## Pre-requirement

  1. Enterprise Distribution Certificates
  2. Developer Distribution Certificates with [adding your friends UDID](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html)
